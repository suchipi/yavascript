- [x] set import.meta.main correctly (will need change in quickjs to support this)
- [x] add path-less-traveled-style pathMarker functionality to Path
  - concat and relativeTo have this covered
- [x] move all of exec and ChildProcess's string/Path/Array/number handling into parseArgString
- [x] expose exec's arg-string-to-array parsing function, for forwarding to 'concurrently', 'nodemon', etc
- [x] accept Path objects in exec array
- [x] make static Path methods return Paths instead of strings
- [x] make quote accept Path objects
- [x] make ls, pwd, etc all return Path objects when possible
- [x] add something to make "this path but with a different extension" and "this path but swap the basedir from this to this" easier
- [ ] finish all the help docs!!!
- [ ] spicy: override types for string-receiving methods to accept anything that can be converted to a string (if quickjs converts it)
- [x] add frozen "initial pwd" somewhere
- [ ] expose "makeErrorWithProperties" somehow. new error constructor? overload base error constructor?
- [x] tests for `which`
- [x] make string color/style functions accept Path objects (convert them to strings internally)
- [ ] InteractivePrompt: screen contents can get messed up when hitting backspace repeatedly
- [ ] InteractivePrompt: spawning one InteractivePrompt from within another results in both running at once. Problem? idk, but it makes it hard to use InteractivePrompt from a repl
- [ ] support source maps for compiled languages
- [ ] pager for long help text (when using repl)
- [ ] create solution for tracing `exec` and friends without it being crazy chatty. maybe log levels
