- [ ] set import.meta.main correctly (will need change in quickjs to support this)
- [ ] add path-less-traveled-style pathMarker functionality to Path
- [ ] move all of exec and ChildProcess's string/Path/Array/number handling into parseArgString
- [ ] expose exec's arg-string-to-array parsing function, for forwarding to 'concurrently', 'nodemon', etc
- [x] accept Path objects in exec array
- [x] make static Path methods return Paths instead of strings
- [x] make quote accept Path objects
- [x] make ls, pwd, etc all return Path objects when possible
- [ ] add something to make "this path but with a different extension" and "this path but swap the basedir from this to this" easier
- [ ] finish all the help docs!!!
- [ ] spicy: override types for string-receiving methods to accept anything that can be converted to a string (if quickjs converts it)
- [x] add frozen "initial pwd" somewhere
- [ ] expose "makeErrorWithProperties" somehow. new error constructor? overload base error constructor?
- [ ] tests for `which`
- [ ] make string color/style functions accept Path objects (convert them to strings internally)
