# cat (function)

Reads the contents of one or more files from disk as either one UTF-8 string
or one ArrayBuffer.

Provides the same functionality as the unix binary of the same name.

> Example: If you have a file called `hi.txt` in the current working
> directory, and it contains the text "hello", running `cat("hi.txt")`
> returns `"hello"`.

```ts
const cat: {
  (paths: string | Path | Array<string | Path>): string;
  (paths: string | Path | Array<string | Path>, options: {}): string;
  (
    paths: string | Path | Array<string | Path>,
    options: {
      binary: false;
    }
  ): string;
  (
    paths: string | Path | Array<string | Path>,
    options: {
      binary: true;
    }
  ): ArrayBuffer;
};
```
