# env (object)

An object representing the process's environment variables. You can read
from it to read environment variables, write into it to set environment
variables, and/or delete properties from it to unset environment variables.
Any value you write will be coerced into a string.

```ts
const env: {
  [key: string]: string | undefined;
};
```
