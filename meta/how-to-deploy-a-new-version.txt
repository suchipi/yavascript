- build everything with env var `YAVASCRIPT_VERSION` set to whatever (eg 0.0.8)
  - looks like you have to edit meta/docker/build-all.sh to get that env var into the container where stuff is built
  - this will update the files in bin/
- run meta/scripts/set-package-version.js to set the package.json version to the same version string
- run npm publish in the npm dir
- commit the changes and push to github
- make a release on github and create a tag from the latest commit with the version name as the tag name
- run meta/scripts/assemble-tgz.ts to make all the archives for each version in the meta/tgz-release folder and then upload all those as release artifacts on github
- build docker images with meta/docker/build-image.sh with the env var `YS_DOCKER_TAG` set to the version string, and then again with it set to "latest"
  - note that this also pushes the images
- use meta/scripts/set-package-version.js to change the version in package.json back to 0.0.0-git and commit and push that

I think that's it
