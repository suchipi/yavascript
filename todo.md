- [x] set import.meta.main correctly (will need change in quickjs to support this)
- [x] add path-less-traveled-style pathMarker functionality to Path
  - concat and relativeTo have this covered
- [x] move all of exec and ChildProcess's string/Path/Array/number handling into parseArgString
- [x] expose exec's arg-string-to-array parsing function, for forwarding to 'concurrently', 'nodemon', etc
- [x] accept Path objects in exec array
- [x] make static Path methods return Paths instead of strings
- [x] make quote accept Path objects
- [x] make ls, pwd, etc all return Path objects when possible
- [x] add something to make "this path but with a different extension" and "this path but swap the basedir from this to this" easier
- [x] ~~finish all the help docs!!!~~
  - [x] take all useful info from help docs and move it into the .inc.d.ts files
  - [x] remove the help docs and make the help function ~~use the dtsmd-generated files instead~~ print a link instead
- [ ] spicy: override types for string-receiving methods to accept anything that can be converted to a string (if quickjs converts it)
  - this is to make Paths easier to work with
- [x] add frozen "initial pwd" somewhere
- [x] expose "makeErrorWithProperties" somehow. new error constructor? overload base error constructor?
  - changed base Error constructor in QuickJS
- [x] tests for `which`
- [x] make string color/style functions accept Path objects (convert them to strings internally)
- [ ] InteractivePrompt: screen contents can get messed up when hitting backspace repeatedly
- [ ] InteractivePrompt: spawning one InteractivePrompt from within another results in both running at once. Problem? idk, but it makes it hard to use InteractivePrompt from a repl
- [ ] support source maps for compiled languages
- [x] ~~pager for long help text (when using repl)~~
  - [x] invalidated since help text is browser-only now
- [-] create solution for tracing `exec` and friends without it being crazy chatty. maybe log levels
- [x] allow catting multiple files together, and do so as binary
- [ ] jsx in the repl behaves weirdly because the repl autocomplete thinks the slash is a regexp literal
- [ ] in windows powershell, numbers printed in the repl (ie from running `2 + 2`) aren't visible
  - works fine in windows Terminal git bash though
- [ ] in windows terminal git bash, in repl, pressing up for history doesn't work past the first item
- [ ] repl sometimes needs you to press Ctrl+C more times than it should
- [ ] fix chmod so it has add/remove semantics and respects existing perms
- [ ] yavascript globals aren't set up in workers
- [ ] add `.on("exit")` support to node-compat `process` shim
- [ ] make assert have nice messages when one isn't specified
- [x] Path normalize handles `../../a` wrong; gives `a`, but should give `../../a`
- [x] `inspect(Path.prototype)` fails due to `[inspect.custom]` handling
- [x] finish filling out `meta/scripts/lib/generated-doc-links.json5`
- [-] whoami
  - [x] macOS
  - [x] linux
  - [ ] windows
- [-] open/xdg-open
  - [x] api added (as `openUrl` function)
  - [ ] test on linux/win32
- [ ] hostname
- [x] make the readme more "first-reader-friendly" (ie. reorder some of the info, add a logo, etc)
- [ ] move some of the static properties on Path to some sort of "os" thing, along with other similar helpers. maybe extension of the existing "quickjs:os" `os` global?
- [x] there's something wrong with yavascript.d.ts that's making it not take effect
- [x] deduplicate nice-path from clef-parse (make it use Path global instead)
- [ ] release a new version
