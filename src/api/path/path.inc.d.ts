/**
 * A class which represents a filesystem path. The class contains various
 * methods that make it easy to work with filesystem paths; there are methods
 * for adding/removing path components, converting between absolute and relative
 * paths, getting the basename and dirname, and more.
 *
 * All functions in yavascript which accept path strings as arguments also
 * accept Path objects. As such, it is recommended that all filesystem paths in
 * your programs are Path objects rather than strings.
 *
 * Every Path object has two properties: `segments` and `separator`. `segments`
 * is an Array of strings containing all the non-slash portions of the path. For
 * example, the path "one/two/three" would have segments `["one", "two",
 * "three"]`. `separator` is which slash is used to separate the segments;
 * either `"/"` or `"\"`.
 *
 * A Path object can represent either a POSIX-style path or a win32-style path.
 * For the win32 style, UNC paths are supported. POSIX-style paths starting with
 * "/" (eg. "/usr/bin") have an empty string at the beginning of their segments
 * array to represent the left-hand-side of the leading slash. For instance,
 * "/usr/bin" would have segments `["", "usr", "bin"]`.
