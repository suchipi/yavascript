# `yavascript` - info about the currently-running yavascript binary

The `yavascript` global contains metadata about the currently-running yavascript binary, as well as access to yavascript's compilers for compile-to-js languages.

```ts
// Defined in yavascript/src/api/yavascript
declare const yavascript: {
  /**
   * The version of the currently-running yavascript binary.
   *
   * Will be something formatted like one of these:
   * - "v0.0.7"
   * - "v0.1.3-alpha"
   * - "git-286a3a336849"
   * - "git-286a3a336849-dirty"
   *
   * Or, more formally: either a "V" version string or a "GIT" version string:
   * - "V" version strings start with the character 'v', followed by a semver
   *   version string, optionally followed by the character '-' and any
   *   arbitrary content afterwards.
   * - "GIT" version strings start with the prefix "git-", followed by the
   *   first 12 digits of a git commit SHA, optionally followed by the
   *   character '-' and any arbitrary content afterwards.
